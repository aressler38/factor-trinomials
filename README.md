## About

        
    * Currently, this is a program that will display a diamond that is to be used
      with a generic rectangle for factoring quadratic expressions (ax^2 + bx +c).
    * The diamond.js file handles everything that has to do with the diamond.
    * Custom events are propogated via a Messenger object.
        * Most of the custom event handling is dealt with in ft-messenger-central.js
    * Initialize the trinomial by calling Diamond(a,b,c), where a, b, c are the 
      leading coefficients of the trinimial.  
    * The diamond is rendered in SVG managed by the JavaScript. 
    

## TODO

    * Finish TODOs in diamond.js 
    * Start/Finish the rectangle.js file to handle the generic rectangle.
