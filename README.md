Use a generic rectangle and diamond to a factor trinomial



        
    Currently, this is a program that will display a diamond that is to be used
    with a generic rectangle for factoring quadratic expressions (ax^2 + bx +c).
        
    I've not seperated the HTML from the JavaScript. However, I have minimized the
    JavaScript to 3 locations: (2) calls to external libraries in the HEAD and
    (1) the main JavaScript program that is implemented below the last DOM element
    in the html BODY. 
        
    The diamond is rendered in SVG managed by the JavaScript. 
            
    comments and TODOs throughout...
