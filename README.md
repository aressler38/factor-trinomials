factor-trinomials
=================

Use a generic rectangle and a diamond to factor a trinomial.


About
-----
    * This is a program that will display a diamond that is to be used
      with a generic rectangle for factoring quadratic expressions (ax^2 + bx +c).
    * Initialize the trinomial by calling Messenger.send("ft-initialize", a,b,c), where a, b, c are the 
      leading coefficients of the trinimial.  

Development Notes
-----------------
